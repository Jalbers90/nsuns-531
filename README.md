<strong>About:</strong> <br>
  This app was my first personal coding/programming project. I began this app about a month after starting to teach myself programming. Fitness has always been a large hobby and important part of my life so combining it with programming seemd natural. After starting this particular lifting program I got a little annoyed by always having to take pictures of my pc screens excel spreadsheet to be able to remember the workout at the gym so I built this app as a simpler way to bring and keep track of my workouts.
